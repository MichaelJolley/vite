**üß™ Vite mode is experimental and many nuxt modules are still incompatible**

**If you find a bug, please report via [issues](https://github.com/nuxt/vite/issues) with a minimal reproduction**

## ‚úîÔ∏è What is working?

- [x] Using vite in development
- [x] Basic server-side rendering
- [x] Basic Hot-Module-Replacement
- [x] Nuxt plugins
- [x] Nuxt components
- [X] Vuex store
- [x] Page middleware
- [X] HTTP module
- [ ] Axios module (works with `--spa`)
- [ ] Composition API
- [ ] Content module
- [ ] Tailwindcss module

## ‚ö° Usage

Install package:

```sh
yarn add --dev nuxt-vite
# OR
npm i -D nuxt-vite
```

Add to `buildModules`:

```js
// nuxt.config
export default {
  buildModules: [
    'nuxt-vite'
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Nuxt >= 2.15.0 is required

## üí° Vite Config

You can pass Vite configurations and plugins into the `vite` entry of `nuxt.config`

```js
// nuxt.config
export default {
  buildModules: [
    'nuxt-vite'
  ],
  vite: {
    /* options for vite */
    vue: {
      /* options for vite-plugin-vue2 */
    },
  }
}
```

More details refer to [Vite's documentations](https://vitejs.dev/config/) and [`vite-plugin-vue2`](https://github.com/underfin/vite-plugin-vue2).

## üêõ Common Issues

üí° Take a look at [issues](https://github.com/nuxt/vite/issues) for known issues and workarounds

#### > Can't find loader handling '.vue' files

While we added a workaround to mitigate this, vite recommends explicitly defining extensions for non javascript assets.

```diff
- import MyComponent from '~/components/MyComponent'
+ import MyComponent from '~/components/MyComponent.vue'
```

#### > Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module ... does not provide an export named 'default'

Vite has an issue for pre-bundling dependencies with named exports (#56). Workaround is to exlude them from `optimizeDeps`

```js
// nuxt.config
export default {
  vite: {
    optimizeDeps: {
      exclude: [
        'date-fns'
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

By default some known packages are excluded. Please reply to #56 to add more known problematic

#### > no such file or directory, rmdir node_modules/.vite/temp

This is a race condition that server cache dir removes when reloading ([vitejs/vite/pull/2299](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/2299))

Currently using a fork of vite to address this issue. If you still have the issue, please add version and error in [#2](https://github.com/nuxt/vite/issues/2)

#### > graphql support

Currently there is no module support for handling gql files ([#31](https://github.com/nuxt/vite/issues/31)).

Best solution for now is to wrap gql code into `js` or `ts` and using [graphql-tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-tag) or using raw GraphQL queries. Remember to add `loc.source.body`.

**Example:**

```js
// queries/products.js
import gql from 'graphql-tag'
export default gql`
  query Products {
    products {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`
```

```js
// pages/index.vue
import products  from '~/queries/products'
export default {
    async asyncData({ $strapi }) {
        const response = await $strapi.graphql({
            query: products.loc.source.body,
        })
        return {
            response
        }
    }
}
```

## Tips for module authors

You can start adding experimental vite support to your modules, considering there are known issues and potential breaking changes.

Here are some tips:

- Avoid depending on webpack features (like loaders) as much as possible
- Avoid depending on vite plugins that do not have webpack alternative since we still use webpack for proudction build
  - ~> Avoid directly depending either webpack or vite, but if had to, consider supporting both
- Use nuxt build options like `build.alias` and `build.transpile` in your modules. This way nuxt can do bundler-level config based on generic options

### Hooks

You can either extend vite config by extending `nuxt.options.vite` in module or using hooks

#### `vite:extend ({ config, nuxt, builder })`

Called one time with vite context and default shared config merged with user config

#### `vite:extendConfig (config, { isClient, isServer })`

Called two times. Once with resolved client config and once with resolved server config.
Use it to apply client/server specific extension.

## ü§î How it works

Nuxt has a powerful hooking system to extend internals.

Default bundler ([@nuxt/webpack](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/tree/dev/packages/webpack)) can be replaced by a nuxt module. `nuxt-vite` replaces webpack by a similar interface to use vite instead of webpack. (see [src/index.ts](./src/index.ts) and [src/vite.ts](./src/vite.ts))

Client-side modules are loaded on demand using vite middleware.

Server-side bundle is being created by another vite instance and written to filesystem and passed using hooks to nuxt server-renderer.
Current approach is not the most efficient way due to usage of filesystem, extra build and lack of lazy loading,
yet much faster than webpack builds. You can opt-out of SSR build using `nuxt dev --spa`.
